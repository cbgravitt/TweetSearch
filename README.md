# TweetSearch
Leveraging Twitter API to show a user's recent tweets as a .csv file.

# How to Use
Launch using python then enter the username (including the @ symbol) of the desired user when prompted. The user's ten most recent tweets will be stored in a file called "out.csv" for you to look at. Data in the file includes username, the text of the tweet itself, and the number of hashtags used. NOTE: This does not include retweets and replies, only original tweets.
